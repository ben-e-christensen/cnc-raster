"""
CameraView - displays the LAST captured still image as a panel embedded in
the Tkinter window (sitting alongside the charge heatmap). Needs Pillow
(pip install pillow) to convert a numpy array (from picamera2) into
something Tkinter can display - this is a genuinely new dependency, not one
this codebase used before.

IMPORTANT: like LiveHeatmap, show_array() touches a Tkinter widget, so it
must only ever be called from the MAIN thread. Capturing the image itself
(CameraController.capture()) is a blocking hardware call that's fine to do
on a background thread - just hop to the main thread before calling
show_array() with the result (see gui.py).
